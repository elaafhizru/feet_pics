*Because your feet deserve the best deals, not just the best toes!*

## Welcome to FeetFinder 3000! 🎉

Are you tired of wandering the wild web in search of the perfect pair of feet at the perfect price? Look no further! FeetFinder 3000 is here to save your toes (and your wallet). This nifty little project scans multiple websites faster than you can say "pedicure" and tells you *exactly* where you can buy those fabulous feet — I mean, *feet* shoes, slippers, or even *feet* models (we don't judge).

## What Does FeetFinder 3000 Do? 🤖

- **Scan multiple websites** for your desired foot-related items  
- **Compare prices** across platforms — because nobody likes paying more!  
- **Display the best deal** so you can buy *feet* with confidence  
- **Notify you** when prices drop — because who doesn't love a good sale?

## Features (Because Feet Should Be Fancy) ✨

- 🦶 **Foot Size Detection** (No, not your shoe size—though we handle that too!)  
- 🌐 **Web Scraping** from popular sites like FootShop, ShoeMall, and more (we're the foot detectives)  
- 💰 **Price Comparison** so you can get your feet *at the best price*  
- 📬 **Email Alerts** for when prices drop (because you have better things to do than refresh pages all day)
